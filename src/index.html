      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        Hello again! You alrealy now my name and you can address me as Hanh. I have always been
        interested in tech, especially how people make the cool tools and apps I use everyday.<br /><br />

        However, I wasn't interested in programming or think that it would be something I can do.
        Nevertheless, life has other plan for me. My passion for programming started out as writing
        simple automation scripts in Excel and blossomed into enrolling at my current bootcamp.<br /><br />

        I love learning about new technologies and putting it into practice with my experiments.
        Below are some of the technologies I'm familiar with but I'm always ready to learn and
        grow.<br /><br />
